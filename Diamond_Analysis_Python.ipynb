    "There is a large amount of information about diamonds and many of there characteristics. Data sets usually have data about diamonds carat, cut, color, clarity, and price. The diamond data set from Kaggle also in clued an x, y, and z coordinate allowing for the calculation of a diamond volume. The data set from Kaggle was large with over 50,000 different diamonds varying in cut, carat, color, clarity, and price. This data set sparked interesting in what certain diamond characters affect other characters. In this project, I will be analyzing a data set of diamond to determine what characteristics affect the price the most, how each characteristic correlates with price. I also have a goal to great a function that will predict the price of a diamond given certain characteristics using regression. Regression analysis is a calculation taking known values to predict values. Regression equations are usually set up in the for y=beta0 + beta1*x + beta2*x...betan*x. "

    "The first step in answering my questions and goals was to import the data set. I used pandas to import the data, then separated the data set into its respective variables. I created a new variable, volume, what is a combination of the x, y, and z dimensions given in this data set. The formula to calculate the volume of a diamond is V=1/2(area*heght)."

    "From the results, I have learned that there is a direct correlation between the size of a diamond and its price. Size represents volume and carat. I used a 6th-degree polynomial fit for carat vs price which shows a direct correlation between price and carat with a slight dip around 2.5-3.8 carats suggesting other factors affect the price. The plot volume vs price shows a direct correlation with an increase in volume and price with only on outlier at 420 mm^3. Volume is not the best way to predict price because as you can see there is some diamond with a volume close to zero with a price range of 2500 - 18500 USD. The box and whisker plots show the mean price and max price vary suggesting it must be a combination of color, cut, clarity, carat, and volume to determine the price. The regression analysis of price regressed on volume, carat, color, clarity, and cut showed that carat of a diamond has the largest effect on price with a beta coefficient of 8729.2631. The volume of a diamond has the smallest effect on price with a beta of 1.9410. The linear regression suggests all colors have a negative effect on price but color E with a beta of -211.9140 has the smallest effect on price with respect to color. An ideal cut diamond is the best for the price with a beta of 992.8232. The clarity of a diamond had the second-largest effect with clarity IF having a beta of 5416.9794. The beta means that if a diamond has that characters such as clarity IF it will have a price increase of 5416.9794. For example, a diamond with a carat of 2 would be 2*the beta coefficient for a carat which is  8729.2631. "
